This

    ./dab2eti 215072000 49.6 | ./eti2mpa 1 | mpv --no-resume-playback -

## gui
And actually working:    
Qt_DAB-x86_64.AppImage,  dabradio-x86_64.AppImage

## RTL2832U based usb stick

does at least:

- frequency scanner (gqrx-sdr - Software defined radio receiver), Including FM radio stations.
- DAB (digital radio)
- DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting â€” Terrestrial)
