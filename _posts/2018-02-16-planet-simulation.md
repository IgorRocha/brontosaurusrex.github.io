Note that this has almost nothing to do with reality, the 'moons' are not affecting each other gravitationaly, same for the two 'planets'. The 'force' however does resemble some gravitational properties. What is interesting is that it doesn't seem to be easy to make this thing 'stable' without some amount of 'flow' (air flow/eter?/black matter?).
