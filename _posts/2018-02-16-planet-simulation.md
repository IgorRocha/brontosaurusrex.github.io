Note that this has almost nothing to do with reality, the 'moons' are not affecting each other gravitationaly, same for the two 'planets'. The 'force' however does resemble some gravitational properties. What is interesting is that it doesn't seem to be easy to make this thing 'stable' without some amount of 'flow' (air flow/eter?/black matter?).

edit: Possibly better way to set this up is [described here](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/57090/how-do-i-make-two-objects-pull-toward-each-other-in-a-zero-gravity-scene), but it missed the part where force null object would have to be the same size as the parent object and force shape would have to be set to 'surface' (i think).
