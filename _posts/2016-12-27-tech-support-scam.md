Narrations are interesting on more than one layer, mostly it is a question (a game) of trust I guess. 

Interesting details from some of the catchers where 'Microsoft' is supposed to be something trusted and 'MS certificated guy' is not. 

p.s. And from the opposite side there is this 'seven layer firewall', just hillarious.

A sad clash of two cultures, slam-dog millionaire vs 'Legit' Microsoft generation (Not sure which one is worse).
