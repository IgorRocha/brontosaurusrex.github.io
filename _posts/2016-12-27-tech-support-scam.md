Narration/Storytelling is interesting on more than one layer, mostly it is a question (a game) of trust I guess. 

Interesting details from some of the catchers where 'Microsoft' is supposed to be something trusted and 'MS certificated guy' is not. 

And from the opposite side there is this 'seven layer firewall', just hillarious.

A sad clash of two cultures, slam-dog millionaire vs 'Legit' Microsoft generation (Not sure which one is worse).

Each&Everything nicely translates to another side of the ocean to the Rich&Fat.

I **almost** wonder what would [Slavoj Žižek](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Slavoj+%C5%BDi%C5%BEek) said. 

Now go and find that ctrl + žblj on your keyboard, ... sir.
