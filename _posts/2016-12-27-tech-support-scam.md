Narrations are interesting on more than one layer, mostly it is a question (a game) of trust I guess. Also interesting details from some of the catchers where 'Microsoft' is supposed to be something trusted and 'MS certificated guy' is not. 

A sad clash of two cultures, slam-dog millionaire vs 'Legit & superdumb' Microsucks generation (Not sure which one is worse).
