_This plugin should support decoding of all ffmpeg supported video formats with frame accurate seeking in avi, mkv and mp4 and possibly some others. Haali's parser is used for matroska since the ffmpeg one has serious issues and ffmpeg for everything else. Opening files is however a bit slow due to the required indexing._
