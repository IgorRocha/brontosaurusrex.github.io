Bunch of questions arises:

- What is the actual sensor size (in mm)?
- Is the sensor covered the same in 4k and HD mode?
- rolling shutter? ("No" is right answer here)
- What do I need to use canon SLR lens? Any problems to expect there?
- Does fs5 have better ergonomics, less hacks to the body needed? 
- If fs5, can I live with XAVC long gop (If the camera is twice as cheep I could)
- Why would I need a plugin for basic grading, does Adobe have "interpret footage, S-log3" option? And why not?
- Yeah picture looks very correct, but also very boring and that film stuff post isn't helping, what's wrong with cine gamma thingy? (Or what was it called)
- Would cine gamma and S-log work together or how is that working?
- Whats up with raw out of the box without some stupid external recorder?
- What kind of external monitor (mounted on camera or not) should I get and will it preview/render s-log stuff properly?
- How expensive are the cards? (In my case I need just one or two to cover about 1 hour of recording)
- canon mic inputs?
