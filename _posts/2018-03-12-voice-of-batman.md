1. Audacity, record some talking
1. ctrl + d to duplicate track
1. on top track *effect/change pitch*, set percent change to -16
1. bottom track, same thing, but do -20
1. maybe *select all* (ctrl + a) and *effect/change speed*, set speed multiplier to 0.95
1. maybe some sort of compressor on everything
