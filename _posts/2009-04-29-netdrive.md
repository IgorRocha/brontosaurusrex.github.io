_With NetDrive, managing your remote FTP and WebDAV servers will be as easy as any old file folders on your PC.</p> 

Once you mount the local drive, you don't need to run an application or an FTP client interface but a simple drag-and-drop in your Windows Explorer will be sufficient to transfer and manage files.
