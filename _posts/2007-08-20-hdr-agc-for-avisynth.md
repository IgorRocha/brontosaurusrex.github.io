_High Dynamic Range Automatic Gain Control &#8211; this plugin increase dynamic range of video clips (enhance shadows). It's &#8220;simply&#8221; gaining (brightening) dark areas of image without causing blow of highlights and is doing it by simulating the work of our eyes. Amount of gain is calculated automatically but you can also influence on it by parameters._

usefull for automagically corecting crappy amateur shots.
