Number of posts written

    ls 2016* | wc -l
    334
    
Number of words written (that's including machine generated markdown headers, markdown itself and a lot of quoting)

    cat 2016* | wc -w
    16304
    
Which would take one full floppy of disk space (thats text only, no images)

    du -ch 2016* | tail -1
    1.4M	total

Wordcloud analysis  
"Blender" and "Debian" are part of wings, eye is shaped like "USB" and "data" is on the backside. "Terminal" and "apt-get" seems to be part of the heart <s>digestive system</s> and video is on the neck. "Sudo" seems to be the center (chi) of the creature. "Ffmpeg" seems to be stuck in the .... And so on. 

"Media" is way to small and "github" is stuck at the almost extreme end of the tail (also way to small). "hardware", "volumetric" and head-down "progress" are parts of small brain.

There is also "PBR" at the top-middle of the wing suggesting that cycles quality is my problem (That's Blender renderig engine). "Using" and "crontab" are on the top of the neck, where crontab deserves way larger font really.
