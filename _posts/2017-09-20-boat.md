## ufraw (& ufraw-batch cli)

Standalone utility, fast and simple. (Problems with crop/downsize = unwanted black borders)

### Notes

Changing darktable gui font

    cp /usr/share/darktable/darktable.css ~/.config/darktable
    # and change font definition to
    font: 11pt Cuprum;
    
All tools are missing decent spot-healing method at present time.
