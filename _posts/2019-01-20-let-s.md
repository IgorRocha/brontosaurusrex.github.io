> Many OSS teams find themselves building project and community management tools from scratch

No, we have github. edit: And you seem to have wordpress?

> the author never planned to be responsible for a critical piece of digital infrastructure.

That's the big fun of the OSS. In other words I don't particularity care if you can run my scripts or not.

> OSS contributors are often on the receiving end of harassment, demands, and general disrespect

Or the other way around, they disrespect users (human nature, nothing to do with OSS.)

> Inadequate resources

True, I'll happily take all the resources you can provide via fully anonymous system (but thanks for github, It was pretty cool so far).

> Beyond download statistics, maintainers have limited visibility into how their software is used.

I would prefer [not to know](/about/) any kind of statistics and I believe that should be a goal for every developer (or human generally). 

p.s. Actually that is another part of fun with OSS, one may not relate or be driven by any kind of measurable 'success'.

> Communities are not always well-equipped to guide that evolution.

So what. Other way of dealing with things is via giant evil-company umbrella? That's ˇ the picture of it?

> If you’re an open source contributor or maintainer, please join the conversation by filling out the contact form below! 

It looks like a cute form, but no thanks.

> It is commonly accepted that the Universe started in an ordered state with low entropy (S), which allowed its entropy to further increase - as observed - in line with the second principle of thermodynamics.

Agreed.

> I can’t wait to talk to you.

See you around, can't make any promises thought.
