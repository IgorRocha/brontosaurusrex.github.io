Material window must be implemented in a way to not get in a way of player/recorder layouts, it could be a separated screen (see Autodesk smoke*), it could be a floating window ..., it could be a 2nd use for player window.

View2 could be default for smaller screens or smaller program window sizes (but that shall be in preferences).

Buttons like _play, frame back/forward, in, out_ must not drastically increase the distance between player/recorder and timeline, good default seems to be either don't show any or perhaps overlayed over video at proper time (hard one).
