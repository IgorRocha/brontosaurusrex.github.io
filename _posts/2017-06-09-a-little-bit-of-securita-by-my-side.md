## Default Permit

Yeah I don't think my router does that default anything and the other point, yes whitelisting is the way to go as opposed to evil blacklisting.

## Enumerating Badness

> One clear symptom that you have a case of "Enumerating Badness" is that you've got a system or software that needs signature updates on a regular basis, or a system that lets past a new worm that it hasn't seen before. The cure for "Enumerating Badness" is, of course, "Enumerating Goodness."

Again whitelisting vs blacklisting, mostly fixed by now i guess.

## Penetrate and Patch 

> Your software and systems should be secure by design and should have been designed with flaw-handling in mind.

## Hacking is Cool

>  teaching yourself a bunch of exploits and how to use them means you're investing your time in learning a bunch of tools and techniques that are going to go stale as soon as everyone has patched that particular hole. 

## Educating Users
