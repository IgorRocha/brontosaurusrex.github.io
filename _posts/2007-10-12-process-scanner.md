_Our new Process Scanner brings new interactive functionality to the Process Library. Simply click on the scan button and the Process Scanner deep scans your system online to provide within seconds a complete list of all the processes, .dlls and other items that open on your system on startup, while the system is running, or even those which are programmed to run later._
