Untested;  
a._***JointMorph Plus** 
  


> is a displacement handler for Layout. It uses the angle of a control bone to drive morphs, without using expressions.</p>

b. _**Motion Mixer**:
  


> * Non-linear animation system for blending any curve track inside of LightWave 3D®; **Perfect for blending motions, endomorphs or any animatable parameter** in LightWave®      
> * Load and save Hierarchical Motion (HMOT) data containing all relevant components, motions and channels for a character group      
> * Position and scale motions and groups of channels in track view      
> * Quickly blend multiple motion tracks together with user definable curve      
> * Set Pre and Post behaviors for HMOT behaviors      
> * Channel editor allows the user enable/disable independent items or channels from each HMOT behavior      
> * Absolute and Relative Offset motions settings      
> * Animation baking for full scene or defined range      
> * Select by Descendants, Hierarchy, Actor or Motion</p>
