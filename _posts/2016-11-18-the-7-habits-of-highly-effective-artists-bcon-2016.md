> The vast majority of great works throughout history were created by consistently working, every day, over a long period of time.

> Volume, Not Perfection

> Good stealing is when you study the work of many artists and combine them to make something new.
> ...looking at your inspiration file will remind you of why you’re doing it. And it will also provide valuable reference when you’re unsure of how the pros do a certain thing.

> Conscious Learning
> this habit is (in my opinion) the hardest to adopt, because it involves going towards pain, which our brains are wired to avoid.

> Rest
> After a certain point, working harder is actually pointless. Because your eyes become blind to the work’s problems.

> Get Feedback

> Create What You Love
