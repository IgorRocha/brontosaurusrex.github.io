title: Just say NO to backups
---
Backups are bad karma, they are like that saying that "past will always haunt you", so no backups = solved. 

The things you own end up owning you. 

Shelves can have a much better function that holding bunch of ugly external hard drives, you can store clothes there.

There is always something better to do than backups, like playing slither for example.

Work has an implication of loosing energy and backups are also work. The more you work the more backups you will have to consider, it's a circle...

That big hd crash last year, the one where you lost your book, you know it wasn't worth disk space it was taking anyway and if you really care then it's all in your head anyway and you can do a better version now.

Backup devices are unreliable, if you really want something slightly more permanent, there is a page describing 17 things you should know about stone carving (proven to last 1000+ years).

When you get mail like: "We would like to refresh our movie from 5 years, just change the text to ... and wee need that tomorrow..", you can promptly reply with: "No, I have no backups." They are usually incredibly cheap with refreshes, so no time wasted here as well. (If one rewinds 5 years back, they didn't want to hear anything about wasting money for something as basic/simple as 3TB video backup.)

So when everything goes to hell, you can promise yourself that future will be better. That's also cheapest version.

Just say NO to backups.

p.s. And NO to shinny looking icons.
