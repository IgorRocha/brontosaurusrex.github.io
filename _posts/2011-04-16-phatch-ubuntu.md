_Phatch is a simple to use cross-platform GUI Photo Batch Processor which handles all popular image formats and can duplicate (sub)folder hierarchies. Phatch can batch resize, rotate, rename, &#8230; and much more actions in minutes instead of hours or days if you do it manually. Get Started!_

It is in ubuntu repos.
