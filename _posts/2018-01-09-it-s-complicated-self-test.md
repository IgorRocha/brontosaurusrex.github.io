> I have an LG "smart" washer/dryer; the range of washing/drying options and possible combinations is impressive but often confusing, and the manual does nothing to clarify matters. What’s the difference between "Eco" drying and "Normal eco" drying? Why can I set "Eco" drying in combination with a wash cycle, but not "Normal eco", which can only be set on a standalone dry cycle? What does an "Intensive" wash actually do differently from a "Normal" wash? None of this stuff is in the manual.

Fair.

> Not knowing the difference between iMessage and SMS, or what iMessage is except “blue bubbles”

Personally never heard about iMesagge (asumming that something osxish). I guess it gets complicated when SMS is money and the other stuff isn't.

> Not knowing why having an Android user in a group text makes it worse than an iMessage group with iPhone users

What? Is that the same sort of knowhow that makes you send excel crap in attachements?

> Thinking Hulu and Roku were the same thing

I thought they are brothers.

> “Why can’t Siri play Spotify?”

Cos she doesn't who Roku is? Or she is just that complicated and offended.

So I guess it is complicated, or I'am less of a f..... **consumer**.

Is it a **gui** problem? This one is pretty clear I guess:

I'd like a unit with some [mega and gigacycles](https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Last-Import-1-of-154-11.jpg) please.

p.s. This one  
![offOnRedOne.png]({{site.baseurl}}/media/offOnRedOne.png)

is confusing as well:
- Why is red attached to on?
- Why is on down (isn't it usually the other way?)
- Will this start Siri or Roku?
