> I have an LG "smart" washer/dryer; the range of washing/drying options and possible combinations is impressive but often confusing, and the manual does nothing to clarify matters. What’s the difference between "Eco" drying and "Normal eco" drying? Why can I set "Eco" drying in combination with a wash cycle, but not "Normal eco", which can only be set on a standalone dry cycle? What does an "Intensive" wash actually do differently from a "Normal" wash? None of this stuff is in the manual.

Fair.

> Not knowing the difference between iMessage and SMS, or what iMessage is except “blue bubbles”

Personally never heard about iMesagge (asumming that something osxish)

> Not knowing why having an Android user in a group text makes it worse than an iMessage group with iPhone users

What?

> Thinking Hulu and Roku were the same thing

No idea what either of those is.

> “Why can’t Siri play Spotify?”

Why?

So I guess it is, or I'am less of f**** **consumer**.

Is it a **gui** problem? This one is pretty clear I guess:
