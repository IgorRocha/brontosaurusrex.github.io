> Lawrence Krauss gives a lecture about the knowns and unknowns of the universe. Topics range from dark matter, the energy in empty space, dark energy and ...

Can any objective measurement be not subjective?

According to Krauss, one version of *nothing* is fluctuation of particles that obey the zero energy principles. If I got that correctly, giving enough time (before time was born?) can easily pop stuff into existence. Stuff would be matter + time + other?. He does point out experimental proof that most of the time disagrees with what is happening in human head. He acknowledges limits of science which seems to fight human desire to understand everything and now. Science disproves itself.

Phylosophical and religious definition of nothing (again according to Krauss) is absolute...

Math is interesting, it appears to me that it can easily serve both poles (zero penguins, eternal time... < seems not very empirical). Larger than multiverse + imagination?

So religion and partially phylosophie are dogmatic, turned into past and a result of inner-head mental masturbation, they are OUT (have nothing to offer to our view of the universe).

However there is another imaginate discipline called Art, which is IN. It is in a position of showing reality in a subjective form and at the same time predict the possible future. Neil Tyson about the Stary night.
