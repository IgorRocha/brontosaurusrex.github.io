man scp

 > scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as ssh(1).  scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.

From local to remote

	scp data.txt user@remote.com:
    
Remote to local

	scp user@remote.com:data.txt .
    
Run remote command

	ssh user@remote.com uptime

Sometimes you have to be more specific

	ssh user@remote.com /home/pi/bin/toTheMoonWrap
    
Filter out locale warnings, errors

	ssh user@remote.com /home/pi/bin/toTheMoonWrap 2>&1 | grep -v "LC_ALL"
