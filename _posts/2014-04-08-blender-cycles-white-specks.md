in render settings make clamp values higher than 0.

_Olson> brontosaurusrex, anywhere between 2 and 8.. if you go lower than 2 you&#8217;ll likely darken the scene more than you&#8217;d like, though 1.2 maybe you get away with it in some cases, &#8230;. the lower the value, the more the scene&#8217;s accuracy is lowered. the higher you can go above 1 the better_

Yeah, less is more.
