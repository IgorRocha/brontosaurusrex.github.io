_The HD Everio GZ-HD7 is the world’s first* consumer camcorder to offer Full HD 1920x1080i recording. The 1920x1080i picture you get at the camera is maintained for recording, with no conversion to degrade the full native resolution. And once you’re done shooting, JVC’s various Full HD ready products are ready to offer full enjoyment – from viewing on HDTV, to a PC-less archiving solution for Full HD storage without a computer. So for Full HD that makes sense all the way around, see how HD Everio’s advantages make the definitive difference._
