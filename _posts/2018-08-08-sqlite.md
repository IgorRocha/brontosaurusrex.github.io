> SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. A complete SQL database with multiple tables, indices, triggers, and views, is contained in a single disk file.

## bash to sqlite

    echo ".schema one" | sqlite3 "$HOME/tmp/sqtest.db"
    # or use 2nd argument to sqlite as command
    sqlite3 "$HOME/tmp/sqtest.db" ".schema one"

[https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html)

> SQLite commands are normally terminated by a semicolon. In the shell you can also use the word "GO" (case-insensitive) or a slash character "/" on a line by itself to end a command.

Full example for creating table, inserting values and dumping entire table back to stdin

    db="$HOME/tmp/sqtest.db"
    rm "$db"
    sqlite3 "$db" "create table woot(stuff text) ;"
    # where 'stuff' is the name of the column
    sqlite3 "$db" "insert into woot values('mkay') ;"
    sqlite3 "$db" "insert into woot values('drugs are bad') ;"
    sqlite3 "$db" "insert into woot values('very long string with smilie :)') ;"
    
    # show all
    sqlite3 "$db" "select * from woot ;"
    
    mkay
    drugs are bad
    very long string with smilie :)
    
    # search for smilie
    sqlite3 "$db" "select * from woot where stuff like '%:)%' ;"
	very long string with smilie :)"
    
    # add stuff to stuff, and lets break that bash prefix
    sqlite3 "$db" # and I'am in
    insert into woot values ('another smilie :)') ;
