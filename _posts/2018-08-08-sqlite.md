## bash to sqlite

    echo ".schema one" | sqlite3 "$HOME/tmp/sqtest.db"
    # or use 2nd argument to sqlite as command
    sqlite3 "$HOME/tmp/sqtest.db" ".schema one"

> SQLite commands are normally terminated by a semicolon. In the shell you can also use the word "GO" (case-insensitive) or a slash character "/" on a line by itself to end a command.

Full example for creating table, inserting values and dumping entire table back to stdin

    db="$HOME/tmp/sqtest.db"
    rm "$db"
    sqlite3 "$db" "create table woot(char) ;"
    sqlite3 "$db" "insert into woot values('mkay') ;"
    sqlite3 "$db" "insert into woot values('drugs are bad') ;"
    sqlite3 "$db" "insert into woot values('very long string with smilie :)') ;"
    sqlite3 "$db" "select * from woot ;"                                        
    mkay
    drugs are bad
    very long string with smilie :)
