a. in lw render with fprime to openEXR (with alpha if needed)  
b. open 16bpc project in afterFX (can also be changed later)  
c. import openEXR files/sequences   
d. rmb click on footage and interpret footage | turn off 'interpret as linear light' in Color Management  
e. check alpha interpretation  
f. apply curves effect to get some details out from the low and medium tones.  
g. export as 8bpc something  
(this is with proEXR installed, not sure if there is any difference without that&#8230;)
