title: Arc theme and stretch
---
Gtk version was installed with

    sudo apt install arc-theme 

Openbox version in my postbang repo (.themes/Arc-Dark_ob), changes applied [to this](https://github.com/dglava/arc-openbox).

- different ob menu
- icon for maximize stage is different
- other stuff I can't remember

edit: Scrot is showing wrong theme (turns out incompatible with new gtk+), should be Arc-Darker.

p.s. Almost interesting icon theme in repos is faenza-icon-theme (Faenza-Darkest).

Anyway the final-temporary-solution seems to be

    WM Theme:    Arc-Dark_ob           < my postbang git
    Theme:       Arc [GTK2/3]          < repos 
    (Arc dark & darker will not work well with papirus icons)
    Icons:       Papirus-GTK [GTK2/3]  < copy in my postbang git
