> Development of Unix did not actually begin as work on an operating system. Rather, the small group of computer scientists who had seen their positions on the Multics project evaporate at Bell Labs' exit set out to create a file system that could be shared efficiently within their workgroup. The operating system was little more than an afterthought resulting from a need to test this file system.

> Thompson made it clear that there were certain aspects of the file system on the Multics project that he would have liked to see happen, but which were never implemented. A major example is "treating files and devices the same... having the same read calls." This meant that terminals would input and output data in the same format that mainframes did, leveling the playing field between users on different computers.

> The idea of standard input and output for devices eventually found its way into Unix as pipes. Pipes enabled users and programmers to send one function's output into another function by simply placing a vertical line, a '|' between the two functions.

> This concept of building tools for one's own benefit, and adapting them to fit the needs of the group also stood out in Thompson's interview, as he explained his motivations for working on Unix. "I was more interested in myself. Just selfish notions of trying to get a environment to work in."

> The basic construction of the compiler, of the co-generator for the compiler, was based on an idea that I heard about from someone at the Labs at Indian Hill â€” I never actually did find and read the thesis, but I had the ideas in it explained to me so that the co-generator for NB was... based on this Ph.D. thesis.
