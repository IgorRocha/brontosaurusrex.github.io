&#8211; the purpose is just a human name for the control  
&#8211; control is some sort of rule which comes from some dort of behaviour  
&#8211; behaviour is random, but that randomness must be based on some sort of 'natural' laws (think about the group of particles for example)  
&#8211; the particles may be a mistake (or a noise) of zero/null state  
&#8211; the beginning is unclear (but that must be wrong question anyway) &#8211; it is based on perception of time (which is just another control and it is few layers abowe)
