_PathSync synchronizes the contents of two directories. You can choose to synchronize unidirectionally (local to remote, or remote to local), or bidirectionally. Various synchronization options are available, including files to ignore and filename mask. It also provides nifty statistics during the synchronization, so that the user is never wondering how much time is left._

to make it portable:  
Download the installer and extract (you can use 'universal extractor') to a folder of your choice. Remove Source and [NSIS].nsi. Launch pathsync.exe.
