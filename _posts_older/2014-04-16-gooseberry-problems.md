&#8211; art is allready there
  
&#8211; confusing navigation and definiton of web pages
  
&#8211; and yes, you really should not use default wp theme
  
&#8211; too much of everything (I really don&#8217;t care at this point and in some point in the future i&#8217;d like to vote for the sketches and storyline)
  
&#8211; weirdly overexposed side heroes and different hero experiments

p.s. The only amazing (about 2s) animation I saw so far is falling sheep btw.
