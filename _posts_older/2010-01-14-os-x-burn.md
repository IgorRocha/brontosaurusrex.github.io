problems so far:
  
&#8211; when droping bunch of mp3s to make an audio cd, certain song is baked so that it plays in fast-motion, mickey mouse style (nothing funny with the file itself, its 44.1 and eveything)

_Burn is absolutely free and open source. Burn also uses a lot of great free open source utilities to make it tick. Utilities: ffmpeg, lame, liba52, **movtoy4m**, movtowav, vcdimager, dvdauthor, spumux, mkisofs and dvd-author._

from faq:
  
_Does Burn use the same basic burning software that Finder and other
  
Apple apps use? Â That is, if I&#8217;m having problems with burning from the
  
Finder or iTunes, will I always have the same issues burning with Burn?
  
Yes Burn uses Apples DiscBurning.framework. But new engines might be added
  
in the future._
