_It turns out there is a very neat way to do this in OS X, the /etc/paths file! The file contains a list (one per line) of paths that are added to the $PATH variable in the shell. Here are some quick directions to add to the path:</p> 

Open up Terminal.
  
Run the following command:</em>

<pre>sudo nano /etc/paths</pre>

_Go to the bottom of the file, and enter the path you wish to add.
  
Hit control-x to quit.
  
Enter “Y” to save the modified buffer.
  
That’s it! To test it, in **new terminal window**, type:_

<pre>echo $PATH</pre>
