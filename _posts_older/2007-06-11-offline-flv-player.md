_The most important change is the ability to play On2 VP6 encoded FLV files. Other improvements include a resizable window and zoom 1x/2x buttons to allow for quick jumping to the FLV’s original size (after resizing FLV Player’s window, for example) and to look at your .flv file at 200% zoom. Version 1.3.2 and later also supports loading an FLV file or stream from either a regular webserver or an RTMP streaming server._
