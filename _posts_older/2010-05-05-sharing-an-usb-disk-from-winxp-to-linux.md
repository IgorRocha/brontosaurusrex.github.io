&#8211; where with linux i mean: older redhat system
  
&#8211; FAT32 is out of the game, since i have files bigger than 4 gigs.
  
&#8211; modifying linux is not an option, since that particular system is critical

&#8230;so modifying xp box to format/mount ext2 filesystem seems to be a wise choice?
