## This blog operates under this principles

> Freedom of speech is the right to communicate one's opinions and ideas without fear of government retaliation or censorship. The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the dinosaur used.

"We" do NOT track, log, spy or are in any way aware of the user presence on this site. This blog is currently hosted on github, so they may.

## Thinkering and development

## Comments?

So this is statically build site and I don't particulary fancy the idea of plugin in disqus or any 3rd party service like that, but you may use githubs "issues" device for expressing your thoughts (Link should be hidden in that hamburger menu). 

## Me?

Videographer, Linux entusiast, Blender noob, slightly interested in web as well, always wanted to fly.
